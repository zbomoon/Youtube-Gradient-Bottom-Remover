# Youtube-Gradient-Bottom-Remover

I'm annoyed by the white gradient at the bottom that pops up whenever I focus on the YouTube player.

So I decided to try making my first chrome extension plugin.

This extension plugin makes more sense especially when using dark mode.

It was easier than I thought and I was able to finish it in an hour.

- css
```css

.ytp-gradient-bottom {
	display: none;
}

```
